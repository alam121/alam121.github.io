## Projects

#### Master’s Thesis: Unstructured Terrain Navigation for Mobile Agricultural Robot Using  Self-Supervised Learning

- **Description:** In this thesis project, I developed a BLDC-based differential drive autonomous ground robot capable of moving through crop rows. I interfaced sensors for odometry, IMU, Realsense camera, and GPS for ROS. I also developed an online self-supervised network to learn terrain surface properties, enabling the computation of robot-specific 2D surface cost maps. Additionally, I developed a visual crop row navigation algorithm that computes dynamically feasible trajectories by accounting for different surface costs.
